# Machine_Learning_Project
by Hamna Mustafa

I found 2 datasets (> 30k rows); one for Regression and one for Classification and performed different Machine Learning Algorithms on them using R.
For both datasets, I first performed Data Cleaning. Once the data was cleaned up, I explored the data using R functions and R graphs to better understand the data. 
Then, I ran different Machine Learning algorithms on each dataset and analyzed the results. My analysis ranked the algorithms from best to worst and commented on the performance of the algorithms. Furthermore, I also commented on whether these datasets were useful in making predictions for my target value and whether my script was actually able to learn from the data.

# Classification
I found the classification dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/bluehorseshoe/uk-2016-road-safety-data/data?select=Cas.csv 
This contains data about vehicle accidents in the UK in 2016. I chose my target value to be the Number of Casualties column.
I performed Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Decision Trees on this dataset.

# Regression
I found the regression dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult
This contains data about the annual income of people. I chose my target value to be the last column which is the Income column. 
I performed Linear Regression, kNN Regression and Decision Trees on this dataset.
